# From PCA to Autoencoders

Part of the course "Algorithms in Machine Learning" given in 2019 at [ISAE-Supaero](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/) engineering school (fili√®re SDD).

## Course material

This repo contains following course material:

* _slides-anim.pdf_: lecture presentation
* _slides.pdf_: lecture presentation, without animations (lighter)
* _slides/_: slides source
* _bibliography/_: PDFs of cited reference papers
* _MLAutoencoders.ipynb_: practice notebook
* _MLAutoencoders-student.ipynb_: practice notebook, student version with some missing code
* _MLAutoencoders-outputs.ipynb_: practice notebook, with outputs already executed

## Option 1: Running notebooks on Colab

The easiest option to get the notebooks running is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). The only prerequisite is **having a Google account**. Colab provides you a Python environment, all necessary libraries, and a (free!) compute infrastructure with CPU, GPU or TPU.

1. Open [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Import notebook from GitHub.
3. Type "FlorentF9" in the search bar and select the repo "Supaero-mlautoencoders".
4. Open a notebook, for example _MLAutoencoders-student.ipynb_.
5. Click "Copy to Drive" to be able to modify and save a copy the notebook.

## Option 2: Running notebooks locally

The second option is to run the notebooks on your local environment. The required libraries are listed in _requirements.txt_. After having installed the dependencies in your favorite Python environment, simply clone this repo and open the notebooks in jupyter-notebook or jupyter-lab.
